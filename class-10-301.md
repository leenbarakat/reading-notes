# JavaScript Call Stack

## What is a ‘call’?

The call stack **is what a program uses to keep track of method calls**. The call stack is made up of stack frames—one for each method call.

## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

The JavaScript engine has only **one call stack** so that it only can do one thing at a time. When executing a script, the JavaScript engine executes code from top to bottom, line by line. In other words, it is synchronous. Asynchronous is the opposite of synchronous, which means happening at the same time.

## What does LIFO mean?

A stack data structure follows the same principle and it's called a LIFO data structure. LIFO means last in first out, the same way as a stack of dinner plates or other types of the stack in the real world works—the most recent element added to the stack should be the first out.

## Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

## What causes a Stack Overflow?

The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

# JavaScript error messages

## What is a ‘refrence error’?

is thrown when a code attempts to reference a non-existing variable

## What is a ‘syntax error’?

An exception caused by the incorrect use of a pre-defined syntax. Syntax errors are detected while compiling or parsing source code. 

## What is a ‘range error’?

when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value.

## What is a ‘tyep error’?

when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function; or.

## What is a breakpoint?

In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.
