# Lists in HTML

HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

## Three kinds of lists 

**Ordered lists**

An ordered list starts with the ol tag. Each list item starts with the li tag.

**Unordered lists**

An unordered list starts with the ul tag. Each list item starts with the li tag.

**Nested lists**

A nested list or a sublist is a list within a list. The trick to marking nested lists up correctly in HTML is to recognize that the sublist is actually a child of a list item and not of a list.

# JavaScript Events 

HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

HTML Events

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading

An HTML input field was changed

An HTML button was clicked

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
