# Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Since they weren’t planned to be utilized like that. When Handling and his colleagues begun building the internet, being able to talk to any machine anyplace within the world was a essential concern. But most of the procedures engineers afterward utilized to induce computers to conversation to each other didn’t have those prerequisites. You fair required to conversation to a little bunch of machines.

#  What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.
