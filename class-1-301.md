# Component 

## What is a component?

A component may be a measured, convenient, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined usefulness that typifies its execution and exporting it as a higher-level interface. 

 A component could be a program protest, planning to associated with other components, typifying certain usefulness or a set of functionalities. It has an clearly characterized interface and acclimates to a prescribed behavior common to all components inside an architecture.

 A computer program component can be characterized as a unit of composition with a legally indicated interface and unequivocal setting conditions as it were. That's , a program component can be sent freely and is subject to composition by third parties.

 ## Component characteristics

 1- **Reusability** ‚àí Components are ordinarily outlined to be reused in several circumstances in numerous applications. Be that as it may, a few components may be outlined for a particular assignment.

 2- **Replaceable** ‚àí Components may be openly substituted with other comparative components. 

 3- **Not context specific** ‚àí Components are outlined to function completely different situations and contexts. 

 4- **Extensible** ‚àí A component can be amplified from existing components to supply unused behavior.

 5- **Encapsulated** ‚àí  A component portrays the interfacing, which permit the caller to utilize its usefulness, and don't uncover points of interest of the inner forms or any inner factors or state.

 6- **Independent ‚àí Components** are outlined to have negligible conditions on other components.

 ## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

 1- **Ease of deployment** ‚àí As unused consistent adaptations ended up accessible, it is simpler to supplant existing forms with no affect on the other components or the framework as a whole.

 2- **Reduced cost** ‚àí The utilize of third-party components permits you to spread the fetched of advancement and maintenance.

 3- **Ease of development** ‚àí Components execute well-known interfacing to supply characterized usefulness, permitting advancement without affecting other parts of the framework.

 4- **Reusable** ‚àí The utilize of reusable components implies that they can be utilized to spread the improvement and support taken a toll over a few applications or systems.

5- **Modification of technical complexity** ‚àí A component alters the complexity through the utilize of a component holder and its services. 

 6- **Reliability**‚àí The generally framework unwavering quality increments since the unwavering quality of each person component improves the unwavering quality of the entire framework by means of reuse.

7- **System maintenance and advancement** ‚àí Simple to alter and upgrade the execution without influencing the rest of the system. 

 8- **Independent** ‚àí Independency and adaptable network of components. Free advancement of components by distinctive bunch in parallel. Efficiency for the program improvement and future computer program improvement.

 # Props 

 ## What is props short for?

 React may be a component-based library which divides the UI into small reusable pieces. In a few cases, those components got to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass information between components is by utilizing props.

 ‚ÄúProps‚Äù could be a extraordinary catchphrase in React, which stands for properties and is being utilized for passing information from one component to another.

 But the vital portion here is that information with props are being passed in a uni-directional stream. (one way from parent to child) Furthermore, props information is read-only, which suggests that information coming from the parent ought to not be changed by child components.

 ## How are props used in React?

- Firstly, characterize an property and its value(data).

- Then pass it to child component(s) by utilizing Props. 

- Finally, render the Props Information.

When you have a React component who received some props (‚Äúproperties‚Äù) from its parent component, and you want to pass all of those props on to this component‚Äôs child, then you need to pass the entire props object.

If you happen to know all of the props, then you could pass them all by just listing them out individually as the new props for the child component.

Let‚Äôs look at a code example of a ParentComponent that passes all of its props to two child components, DisplayAllProps and ChildComponent.

Here‚Äôs that same ParentComponent, except now it passes all of its props to its two child components without specifying the props individually:

Each of the child components above receives all of the props passed into ParentComponent from its parents (in this case, from an App component).

The spread operator {...props} ‚Äúspreads out‚Äù the properties of the props‚Äô object as arguments (and thus, props) for each child component.

In the App, the React props passed to ChildComponent are name="Johnny", job="üë®‚Äçüé§", and a text string ("üåü") as the children (props.children):

Here is the resulting React app, where ParentComponent has sent all of its props to its two child components, DisplayAllProps and ChildComponent:

## What is the flow of props?

Adding Flow types to your React components is incredibly powerful. After typing your component, Flow will statically ensure that you are using the component in the way it was designed to be used.

Early in React‚Äôs history the library provided PropTypes which performed basic runtime checks. Flow is much more powerful as it can tell you when you are misusing a component without running your code.

There are some Babel plugins which will generate PropTypes from Flow types such as babel-plugin-react-flow-props-to-prop-types if you want both static and runtime checks.
